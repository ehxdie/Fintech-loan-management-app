## Project Overview
Project Overview
Fintech Loan Management System is a full-stack web application that allows users to apply for loans, view loan statuses, make transactions, and manage their accounts. The system includes a back-end built with Java Spring Boot for secure API handling, and a front-end built with React/Next.js and TypeScript for a responsive and modern user interface. The application implements key features such as user authentication, loan application and management, transaction processing, and real-time status updates, along with role-based access control and audit logging.

The back-end is powered by PostgreSQL (or MySQL), and JWT-based authentication ensures secure login and session management. The front-end offers a user-friendly dashboard and form validation, with charts to visualize loan trends and transaction distributions.
